# Glitch.com PHP Skeleton

This is a super basic skeleton to get PHP working out of the box for glitch.com. 
You should be able to download this project, and get PHP running for your glitch
application.

Glitch currently seems to support PHP 7.0, but does have a bunch of extensions
already set up. There is a good chance your framework of choice might work without
too many changes.

## How to Use
To use this project, you will need to create a new project in Glitch, and select
"Clone from Git Repo". Past in this git repo address and it should create a new
project for you!

* https://github.com/dragonmantank/glitch-php-skeleton.git

You cannot import this into an existing project, as the Apache config files will
not carry over for some reason. From there you can pull down the glitch repo
through git and start to work!
